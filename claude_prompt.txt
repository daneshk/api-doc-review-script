  Please review and improve the API documentation in this Ballerina connector repository to ensure it's optimized for the low-code editor view in Ballerina Integrator (BI).

  Documentation Guidelines

  1. Simplify Function Descriptions

  - Make function descriptions simpler and more descriptive
  - Avoid using code snippets in descriptions
  - Focus on what the function does and when to use it
  - Keep: Valid business context, cost implications, performance notes

  Example:
  # Before:
  # Creates a table. The CreateTable operation adds a new table to your account. In an AWS account, table names must be
  # unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different Regions.

  # After:
  # Creates a new table in your AWS account. Table names must be unique within each region.

  2. Add Comprehensive Type Descriptions

  - Add descriptions for ALL enum values
  - The description can span multiple lines
  - Include what each option means and when to use it

  Example:
  # Before:
  public enum ReturnValues {
      NONE, ALL_OLD, UPDATED_OLD, ALL_NEW, UPDATED_NEW
  }

  # After:
  # Which item attributes to return in write operation responses.
  public enum ReturnValues {
      # Return no attributes
      NONE,
      # Return all attributes as they were before the operation
      ALL_OLD,
      # Return only updated attributes as they were before the operation
      UPDATED_OLD,
      # Return all attributes as they are after the operation
      ALL_NEW,
      # Return only updated attributes as they are after the operation
      UPDATED_NEW
  }

  3. Avoid Pro-Code Terminology

  - Remove references to "legacy parameter" - instead use: "Alternative method (use X for newer implementations)"
  - Don't mention internal code constructs in user-facing descriptions
  - Simplify technical jargon where possible

  Example:
  # Before:
  # This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead

  # After:
  # Specific attributes to retrieve (consider using `ProjectionExpression` for newer implementations)

  4. Improve Client/Object Descriptions

  - Make the main client class description comprehensive
  - Describe the purpose and main capabilities
  - Remove "Represents" prefix

  Example:
  # Before:
  # Represents the Ballerina connector for ServiceName.
  # This connector allows you to...

  # After:
  # Client for ServiceName, enabling [list main capabilities].
  # Supports [key operations] and [additional features].

  5. Make Record Field Descriptions More Descriptive

  - Remove "Represents" prefix from record descriptions
  - Be direct and descriptive
  - Keep: "Valid Values:" listings
  - Keep: Important details about costs, limits, behavior

  Example:
  # Before:
  # Represents the AWS credentials.
  public type AwsCredentials record {
      # AWS access key
      string accessKeyId;
  };

  # After:
  # AWS credentials for authentication.
  public type AwsCredentials record {
      # AWS access key ID
      string accessKeyId;
  };

  6. Remove Redundant "Represents" Prefix

  - Don't start record/type descriptions with "Represents"
  - Be direct: describe what it IS, not that it "represents" something

  Example:
  # Before:
  # Represents the response after `WriteBatchItem` operation.

  # After:
  # Response from a batch write operation containing consumption metrics and unprocessed items.

  7. Handle Operation Name References

  - Remove backticks around operation names when describing them naturally
  - Keep backticks for:
    - Field names (TableName, LastEvaluatedKey)
    - Return types
    - Specific attribute names that users need to recognize
    - Enum values when listing options

  Example:
  # Before:
  # The response after `BatchWriteItem` operation

  # After:
  # Response from a batch write operation

  # But KEEP backticks for field references:
  # Use the value from `LastEvaluatedKey` in the next request

  8. Preserve Valuable Context

  - DO KEEP:
    - "Valid Values:" enumerations
    - Cost implications (e.g., "AWS KMS charges apply")
    - Performance notes (e.g., "More efficient than scan")
    - Business logic explanations
    - Multi-line detailed descriptions
    - Limits and quotas (e.g., "Maximum of 20 indexes")
    - Security implications

  Example:
  # GOOD - Keep this detail:
  # Whether server-side encryption is enabled. If enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to KMS
  # and an AWS managed CMK is used (AWS KMS charges apply). If disabled (false) or not specified,
  # server-side encryption is set to AWS owned CMK

  Files to Review

  Typically review these files in order:
  1. Client file (e.g., client.bal, caller.bal)
    - Main client class description
    - All remote function descriptions
  2. Records file (e.g., records.bal, types.bal)
    - All public record types
    - All record field descriptions
    - Remove "Represents" prefixes
  3. Constants/Enums file (e.g., constants.bal, enums.bal)
    - All public enum types
    - Add descriptions for every enum value
    - Remove "Represents" prefixes
  4. Other API files (e.g., utils.bal, stream.bal)
    - Public functions and types

  Critical Issues to Check

  1. ❌ Wrong service description - Verify the client description matches the actual service (not copied from another connector)
  2. ❌ Missing enum value descriptions - Every enum value should have a description
  3. ❌ "Represents" prefix - Remove from all record and enum descriptions
  4. ❌ "Legacy parameter" - Replace with friendlier alternative guidance
  5. ❌ Code snippets in descriptions - Remove complex code examples
  6. ❌ Missing "Valid Values" - Ensure enum field descriptions include valid values

  Task Checklist

  - Fix main client/service class description
  - Improve all remote function descriptions
  - Remove all "Represents" prefixes from records and enums
  - Add missing enum value descriptions
  - Replace "legacy parameter" references with helpful alternatives
  - Remove backticks from operation names (keep for field names)
  - Verify "Valid Values:" listings are present
  - Fix any typos found during review
  - Ensure multi-line helpful context is preserved

  Output Format

  Provide a summary of:
  1. Critical issues found (especially wrong service descriptions)
  2. Statistics (number of records fixed, enums improved, etc.)
  3. Key improvements made with examples
  4. Files modified with brief description of changes
